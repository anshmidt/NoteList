- Need to scroll to top when list switched

- Refactor huge set of lambdas passed to Notes

- Bug: when there are 2 search results, and I edit one of them, sometimes search results
suddenly disappear

- Place cursor at the end when note clicked
(don't want to implement because currently the solution is complicated, maybe in the next versions
of Compose it will get better)
