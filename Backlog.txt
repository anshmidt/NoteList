- Bug: open "To Do" list, force kill app, relaunch app, tap "Add new note" button.
Result: no automatic scrolling, new note is not selected.
For some reasons only on that particular list.
Is reproduced:
in list "Headphones", "Gift ideas", "Mouse", "My first list"(all notes 1-line normal)

- Add ability to change priority in Edit mode

- Bug: when there are 2 search results, and I edit one of them, sometimes search results
suddenly disappear

- Place cursor at the end when note clicked
(don't want to implement because currently the solution is complicated, maybe in the next versions
of Compose it will get better)
